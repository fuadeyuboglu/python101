"""A for loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldn't 
modify a list inside a for loop because Python will have trouble keeping track
of the items in the list. To modify a list as you work through it, use a while 
loop. Using while loops with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store,
and organize lots of input to examine and report on later."""
